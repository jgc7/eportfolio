         <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span> Charms Office Assistant is the online system we use as band directors at Lake for organization, management, and communication for the band program. It is a one-stop-shop location for students, parents, and teachers.  This is a Screencastify recording of my Charms Office Assistant account.<br />
        
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span> Since using Charms Office Assistant, the quality of communication with parents and students has greatly increased, as well as the quality of organization. The students and parents like the easy-to-use interface.  There are many options available to the teacher such as student records, music library, instrument inventory, mass emails, texts, and call-outs, and an assessment tool.  I personally feel like it has been extremely useful and helpful to the students, parents, and teachers.  The students have gotten into a routine of checking Charms to keep up to speed on the calendar.  I know it has saved me time in my classroom by simply reminding them to check Charms. <br />  
          
      <span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span> I know that since I have been using Charms Office Assistant, I am not sure I could teach without it anymore.  At first, it was a little difficult to get used to, but there was a learning curve that I adjusted to.  I know there is a lot more I could do with Charms Office Assistant and I plan on working on that in my off-time. <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xapXxuT8Qr0&feature=youtu.be>Click Here to View</a>

      <td width="798"><b>Remind App </b><br />
         <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span> Last year during the pandemic, I began using Remind for my high school band students.  I would send reminders to the students about upcoming activities and assignments.  It worked well & I thought about using this in classroom for all of my classes.  I can use it to send out group text messages about upcoming assignments, events, or due dates.  Parents can also sign up for it to discuss their child's progress.  I like that students and parents are able to respond back quickly if there are questions or concerns. <br />
        
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span> My students appreciate the Remind messages that come through from me.  Furthermore, I realized sometimes students rely on it too much.  They sometimes do not pay attention enough to due dates but rather become dependent on Reminds.  I do not like that because it takes away accountability.  However, it is an excellent app that allows for easy communication between my students and myself.  Sometimes, students would be afraid to contact me after school for fear of not receiving a timely response. However, with Remind, it comes straight to my phone which is normally close by.  The ease of parents texting is great because I can take pictures of assignments and send it back if thereâ€™s anything in question.  It definitely helps me with parent communication. <br />  
          
      <span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span> This is a great app that I intend to continue to use.  It certainly improves communication not only for me, but for parents and students as well.  After a power outage at our school, we had to come up with a way to effectively communicate up to date information among the staff and our principal intends to create a Remind with staff members cell phones in case this happens.  I think the intent is to keep the lines of communication open and free. <a href=http://www.viewpure.com/IW7DFURLOf4?ref=bkmk>Click Here to View</a>
