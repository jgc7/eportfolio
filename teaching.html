         <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span> Charms Office Assistant is the online system we use as band directors at Lake for organization, management, and communication for the band program. It is a one-stop-shop location for students, parents, and teachers.  This is a Screencastify recording of my Charms Office Assistant account.<br />
        
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span> Since using Charms Office Assistant, the quality of communication with parents and students has greatly increased, as well as the quality of organization. The students and parents like the easy-to-use interface.  There are many options available to the teacher such as student records, music library, instrument inventory, mass emails, texts, and call-outs, and an assessment tool.  I personally feel like it has been extremely useful and helpful to the students, parents, and teachers.  The students have gotten into a routine of checking Charms to keep up to speed on the calendar.  I know it has saved me time in my classroom by simply reminding them to check Charms. <br />  
          
      <span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span> I know that since I have been using Charms Office Assistant, I am not sure I could teach without it anymore.  At first, it was a little difficult to get used, but there was a learning curve that I adjusted to.  I know there is a lot more I could do with Charms Office Assistant and I plan on working on that in my off-time. <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xapXxuT8Qr0&feature=youtu.be>Click Here to View</a>
