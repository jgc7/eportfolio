        <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span>Canvas is a one-stop-shop for all classroom material.  Here, the students can also submit their assignments.  Summative and Formative assignments are also weighted proportionally so grades can be transferred from Canvas into the gradebook eSchool. <br />
        
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span>When we first rolled Canvas out to the students, they did not like it.  Staff had trouble with it as well because we were used to doing things with Google.  We were used to Google Drive integrating with Google Classroom.  But as I have learned, I have started to become more comfortable with the interface and the design of the website. In fact, I can’t imagine teaching without Canvas anymore.  The students have also become more comfortable.  Students were hesitant at first were to take assessments online but only because it was different.  I am able to listen to recordings from students and grade them with a rubric on Canvas. <br /> 
        
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span> I intend to continue to develop my homepage for Canvas.  I would like to perhaps create some links within the homepage that the students wouldn’t even have to navigate away from the homepage.  There are a lot of tools within Canvas that I have not used yet, so I intend to become more familiar with them. <a href=http://www.viewpure.com/_fQK6qj2oqs?ref=bkmk>Click Here to View</a><br />

      <td width="798"><b>Beginning of the Year Needs Assessment </b><br />
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span> At the beginning of the year, I have students fill out an informational needs assessment.  I have done this every year I have taught and it seems to evolve the more experience I acquire.  I used to have them complete this on a note card but now with Google Form, this is easy to compile the results.  The assessment provides me simple information such as name, birthday, and extra-curricular involvement but more importantly IEP/504 information including accommodations.  This Google Form is compiled into a spreadsheet using Google Sheets that I can refer to multiple times throughout the year.  One of the most important parts is asking what three things the students want me to know about them.  Some students share personal information or learning style preferences.  Others share silly things that make me smile.  But either way, this helps support teaching and learning and allows me to develop a solid rapport with my students. <br />
        
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span> Each year, this document evolves based on my audience.  I have modified it and placed more of an emphasis on IEP and 504 information.  That is really valuable because I do have a copy of the IEPs or 504s and I can compare them to what the students need or utilize.  Some of my students have accommodations and do not use them, but they still need to be available by law.  I think this is also very impactful to my teaching because I can look at this and make a connection to my students based on what they have shared with me. <br /> 
        
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span> I intend to continue using this and modifying it or adding to it as I continue to teach.  I am continuing to find ways to get a better understanding of what type of student I will be dealing with in the upcoming year.  The intent is to create a relationship with the student right off the bat.  <a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe2A7C_pDOA26Zpz8AUUfkx-2EHlFVE0ULFQlqMDt0N9gtcHg/viewform>Click Here to View</a> <br />
