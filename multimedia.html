         <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span> After creating my video presentations about the projects I have created in the IT program, I learned how to make video presentations to be able to communicate with my students at home. I started creating video presentations with Screencastify for assignments. <br />
        
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span> Screencastiy was first introduced to me through our tech team at school, but I never used it until I became a student in the IT program. Now I can create video lessons for my students to watch if they are absent. This has been very helpful during the pandemic while students have not been at school. Students enjoy having these videos to pause and learn from at home to help them while completing the assignment. <br />  
          
      <span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span> I plan to reach out to other teachers to research how they are using Screencastify for their classes to give me more ideas. I also am considering creating more of a flipped classroom for some assignments to help promote mastery-based learning. <a href=https://youtu.be/UAGZBuV-5uw>Click Here to View</a>
