          For this project, I worked with four classmates. We spent the semester creating documentation and a prototype for our WBLS to educate a 5th Grade Social Studies class. We used various technologies including Zunal, Google Forms, Screencastify, and Power Point. We also had three experts review the WBLS and two students who provided feedback for creation of this final prototype. <a href="WBLS Final Paper - Jared Cooey.pdf">Click Here to View</a> <br />

         <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span> After creating my video presentations about the projects I have created in the IT program, I learned how to make video presentations to be able to communicate with my students at home. I started creating video presentations with Screencastify for assignments. <br />
        
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span> Screencastiy was first introduced to me through our tech team at school, but I never used it until I became a student in the IT program. Now I can create video lessons for my students to watch if they are absent. This has been very helpful during the pandemic while students have not been at school. Students enjoy having these videos to pause and learn from at home to help them while completing the assignment. <br />  
          
      <span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span> I plan to reach out to other teachers to research how they are using Screencastify for their classes to give me more ideas. I also am considering creating more of a flipped classroom for some assignments to help promote mastery-based learning. <a href=https://youtu.be/UAGZBuV-5uw>Click Here to View</a>

         <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span> At the end of every school year, a slide show is put together for the students and presented at the annual band banquet. Students also have the opportunity to purchase a band yearbook that is assembled by our student band historians. This year, we decided to combine the two into one i-Movie. This is what I created with the help of our student band historians. <br />
        
        <span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span> The main reason we did it this way was due to the pandemic and the fact we would not be having a band banquet this year and we didn’t have the ability to sell the band yearbooks. However, this movie presentation was such a hit that we plan to use it from now on. We are able to incorporate both videos and pictures and it’s at no cost to the students. This was a very uplifting thing for the students to be able to see. <br />  
          
      <span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span> I plan on continuing to create this project with the students each year since it was such a success. I also intend to find other ways to create short i-Movie presentations for each of the grade levels, as this one was only for the high school band students. I believe the younger students in grades 5-8 would also enjoy something like this. <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AYD6TdoI0k&feature=youtu.be>Click Here to View</a>
