       <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span> I attended the 2019 OMEA Professional Development Conference in Cleveland, Ohio. One of the clinics that I attended at this conference titled Google Band, led by Mr. Stephen Keys. 
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span> I learned about many different types of technology that can be included in the band classroom including Google Suite, Flipgrid, Screencastify, Flat, Noteflight, Soundtrap, MusicTheory.net, and many more.  I was aware of many of the tools that were presented, but was not aware of the value they could have in music teaching. I also learned about many tools for the first time that I could immediately begin using in my classroom. Another emphasis of the clinic was that the use of technology should be for enhancement, not replacement of playing instruments. 
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span> Reflecting on this clinic, I have realized that there are many more tools and programs that I was aware of that can be used for the band classroom. I will need to assess whether nor not the technology enhances my lessons and motivates my students to practice more. My goal is to continue to explore the programs and tools that were presented to see if they will increase my studentâ€™s achievement.
