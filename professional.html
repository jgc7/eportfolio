       <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span> I attended the 2019 OMEA Professional Development Conference in Cleveland, Ohio. One of the clinics that I attended at this conference titled the Ed Tech Bandroom, led by Mr. Stephen Keys. 
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span> I learned about many different types of technology that can be included in the band classroom including Google Suite, Flipgrid, Screencastify, Flat, Noteflight, Soundtrap, MusicTheory.net, and many more.  I was aware of many of the tools that were presented, but was not aware of the value they could have in music teaching. I also learned about many tools for the first time that I could immediately begin using in my classroom. Another emphasis of the clinic was that the use of technology should be for enhancement, not replacement of playing instruments. 
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span> Reflecting on this clinic, I have realized that there are many more tools and programs that I was aware of that can be used for the band classroom. I will need to assess whether nor not the technology enhances my lessons and motivates my students to practice more. My goal is to continue to explore the programs and tools that were presented to see if they will increase my studentâ€™s achievement.

       <span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span> I attended the 2019 OMEA Professional Development Conference in Cleveland, Ohio. One of the clinics that I attended at this conference titled the Music First, led by Mr. Mike Olander. 
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Impact:</span> At this clinic, I learned about the Music First program which, at least at the time, was the only music-specific learning management system. This system is mainly used as a music performance assessment tool. Students are able to record on Music First, and the program will assess where the student's mistakes are. This was the first time I had heard of such a program. 
<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Intent:</span> Reflecting on this clinic, I know that there are a couple of music assessment programs out there that can be beneficial to students because they provide immediate feedback to them during their home practice. This is something that band directors have never really been able to provide and it could be an amazing tool. They are also very expensive, so determining how much of the music budget to use on such a program will take some thought.
